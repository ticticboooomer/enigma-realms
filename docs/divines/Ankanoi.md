# Ankanoi

Ankanoi, Divine good. Ankanoi is known for blessing those who follow their path in fulfilling a good and pure lifestyle.

Some believe you must stay on the right side of the law to become and remain blessed by Ankanoi; Others believe the law plays no part in being pure good. Despite the difference in opinion, the one rule of Ankanoi's blessing, which remains fully understood and well documented, is that of Ankanoi's Sole Commandment.

Ankanoi's Sole Commandment is the only demand of the Divine. Followers of Ankanoi must remain at peace, and conflict of any kind is regarded as impure and will forbid such followers from ascending to the Temple of Ankanoi upon death. It is said that those who strafe apart from Ankanoi will experience conflict within themselves; they will become unsettled and fear-ridden.

Ankanoi has no use for arcana or material as they will never rise to conflict.
